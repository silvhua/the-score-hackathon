# theScore Connect

‘Meetup’-meets-’Facebook Groups’  but for sports fans.

theScore Connect is a community events platform that draws on the social element of sporting events and sports viewership. It engages sports fans through opportunities for social engagement and the love of sports. 

## Overview

This project was completed during a 24-hour industry hackathon organized by BrainStation with industry partner, theScore. All participants were students of BrainStation’s Software Engineering program.

Out of 7 teams, this project was awarded first prize by the judges consisting of theScore staff members.

### Problem

theScore is a successful Canadian mobile-first sports media company founded in 1997. How might theScore keep sports fans engaged in its products when their favorite sports leagues are not live, e.g. no matches scheduled, during the off-season, or during a lockout?

### User Profile

Target customers include those who want to advertise:
large sporting/sport-related events
smaller community sporting events.
Early adopters include:
existing Score fans
visitors/community members looking to grow their network! 

### Project Roadmap

* Lean Canvas Product Development Method - breaking down the problem and investigating solutions in this problem space. 
* Research - Surveying the market to see if existing solutions exist & if there is a gap we are addressing.
